# Stack Overflow - Question Modeling for Quality-of-Life

**Author**: Will Dougherty

## Overview

With millions of questions and answers, Stack Overflow is a uniquely positioned resource for the coding community. Though often criticized and complained about, it's an invaluable tool to find answers and discussion about very specific coding problems very quickly.

In this project, I used Natural Language Processing (NLP) to predict both quality and the tags for Stack Overflow questions, to provide the foundation for implementing features that could be used in the moment of posting - that is, a user could be alerted if their post is likely to be low-quality, and tags could be suggested based on the text of the question. In both cases, the models do a good job of accomplishing their objectives, and the analysis that led to them informs their best usage and implementation.

### Business Problem

Stack Overflow also occupies a unique position in that it is in the form of a Q&A platform, but is often used as a wiki, or general knowledge base. With aggressive post moderation (i.e. removal of duplicate/already-answered questions) and an upvote system, the focus of the site is on both quality, and ease of search.

#### Stakeholder for project

The targeted stakeholder for this project is Stack Overflow itself, specifically the teams/departments in charge of moderation and the posting system.

As well, this type of work is potentially applicable to other similar situations on other websites that utilize Q&A, especially those with upvoting, tagging, etc that would be directly benefitted by the results of this project.

***
***

The two main components of this project are:
- Question quality
- Tagging

Anything that can be done in the moment of posting a question, before it's 'out in the wild', will help take the pressure off of the moderation team and all of the behind-the-scenes tools that are used to help weed out bad posts, and to make sure that proper tags are assigned.

#### I. Quality

This component aims to predict, without an imbalance of false negatives and positives, whether a post is 'high' or 'low' quality - a binary classification. If a user's question is then compared against this model, they can be alerted if it is likely to be low quality, and given a chance to review the post guidelines and re-examine the question before posting it.

#### II. Tagging

This component aims to predict, and then suggest, a field of most-likely tags for a given question. Currently, the user is presented with an empty entry field; although it auto-completes as you type tag names, it isn't based on the text of the just-written question.

Because of the subjective nature of tagging, it would be best to suggest the top 20 or so tags that are most likely to apply to a given question's text. This allows the user to select the ones they feel are most applicable, and even if all of the 'true' tags aren't present, the model is accurate enough that it will likely help the user remember/be reminded of tags that they may not have otherwise thought of.

## Question Quality

### Data

There are several datasets of Stack Overflow post data, and for this component I am using two different datasets.

To run this code yourself, please download the data from the links below and place the files in folders as described.

- 60k Stack Overflow Questions with Quality Rating
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imoore/60k-stack-overflow-questions-with-quality-rate
- Importing data: download archive, and extract 'train.csv' and 'valid.csv' to 'data/Quality_60k'

This is used to build the model, as it contains ground-truth quality ratings. It is limited to only posts with the 'python' tag.

- Python Questions from Stack Overflow
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stackoverflow/pythonquestions
- Importing data: download archive, and extract 'Questions.csv', 'Answers.csv', and 'Tags.csv' to 'data/QA_python'

This is much larger, and is used to see how the smaller dataset's model compares against a larger dataset. This is not used to build the model because there is no concrete 'quality' rating, and only things like 'Score' and 'answer_count' are available.

However, as we'll see, the smaller model does seem to have correllation with those aspects of the larger dataset, which suggests further work is warranted.

### Methodology and Goals

For a little reading on some meta discussion of the problem of low-quality questions, this is a very insightful page from tghe "Meta.StackExchange.com" site:
* <a id="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/56817/can-we-prevent-some-of-the-low-quality-questions-from-entering-our-system">Atwood, Jeff. (2010). "Can we prevent some of the low-quality questions from entering our system?"</a>

***

In order to predict quality, the text must be cleaned and vectorized, and class imbalance addressed.

For modelling, Logistic Regression is relatively cheap (in system resources and training time) and well-suited to this relatively straightforward modelling problem.

### Target Metrics

#### Balanced Accuracy

I will target the balanced accuracy score (using 'balanced_accuracy_score()') to judge the best classifier. Since this model will be used to predict quality, and generate alerts if a question is likely to be low-quality (which would need editing or removal from the site) I don't want to skew either towards False Positives or False Negatives, so recall for either class would be insufficient.

In addition, simple 'accuracy' would be skewed by class imbalance, so the balanced accuracy takes this into account. This will help to ensure that I don't have too many instances of low-quality posts slipping through, nor high-quality posts mislabelled as low-quality, annoying those users unnecessarily.

Besides simply calculating the score, I'll also use confusion matrices to see it visually at a glance, especially if there are more than 2 targets.


![graph1](./images/qa_python_clean.png)

Based on EDA, I was able to find an optimal (or at least high-performing) method of cleaning the text data:

- combine title and body text
- remove HTML tags
- remove code
- remove stopwords
- stemming
- other misc. cleanup (whitespace, etc)

This can be seen in the first few columns above.

***

### Modelling

In order to test the model, I'll use the included holdout set.

Since class imbalance is an issue, I opt to use the RandomOverSampler, so we can generate a balanced proportion of class '1' (high-quality) samples, so as to help the model train properly.

Finally, fitting the LogisticRegression model with tuned hyperparameters allows us to see plot how well it does at predicting the two classes.

![graph2](./images/conf_matrix.png)

#### Evaluation

So we see a strong result here. With 87% of the 'low quality' label, and 85% of the 'high quality' label correctly predicted, we don't have a strong skew either way that would disproportionately affect either target class. False positives would allow low-quality posts to slip through, and false negatives would annoy users who are writing a high-quality question.

##### Vs. Baseline model

A baseline model would simply predict '0' for every class, and thus achieve an accuracy of 67% since 2/3 of the samples are in the '0' class. Thus, the model does a good job of not only improving on accuracy, but actually distinguishing the two classes, and balancing it very well.

***

To add on to this, because of the lackluster results of directly modelling the larger Python Q&A dataset, I'll take a look at how well this smaller model can do in labelling the larger dataset's samples, and how that lines up with the 'Score' and 'answer_count' features, since those are the closest proxy for 'quality' in that dataset.

I will use the entire 60k dataset as the training data, and test it on 100,000 samples of the larger Python dataset.

![graph3](./images/quality_pred.png)

There is a clear correlation between Score and the predicted quality target.

The nature of the datasets is likely somewhat different, since the 60k dataset probably has posts that were removed because of low quality, and the Python Q&A dataset likely only has posts that are still up.

However, this is encouraging to see such a clear gradient from left to right, which suggests that with more data on post quality from Stack Overflow, a very high-performing model could be built to predict quality and alert users.

## Tag Prediction and Suggestion

### Data

For this component, I will use this dataset. As before, to run the code yourself download from the link below and place the data in the folder as described.

- StackSample: 10% of Stack Overflow Q&A
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stackoverflow/stacksample?datasetId=265&sortBy=commentCount&select=Questions.csv
- Importing data: download archive, and extract 'Questions.csv', 'Answers.csv', and 'Tags.csv' to 'data/QA_all'

It is structured identically to the Python Q&A dataset, but includes posts with all tags. Limiting it to the 'Python' tagged posts creates issues with how it's modelled and validated.

#### Introductory reading on tags

I found this article to be inspiring and gave me a good feel for the broad strokes and diversity of tags in the data:
* <a id="https://minimaxir.com/2018/02/stack-overflow-questions/">A Visual Overview of Stack Overflow's Question Tags</a>

### Methodology and Goals

The goal is a model that can provide suggested tags to a user, before they post their question. Users are given an entry field to enter tags, but it only auto-completes when you start typing. This can enable better and faster tagging for users, and facilitate better searching and generation of 'related post'-type features on the site.

The model itself is predicting tags for each post, but to generate a top-20 list of suggested tags, the model needs to provide probabilities the for all tags for that post.

So ultimately, to achieve this, a Multi-Label Classification model is needed. This is in fact a collection of models, one for each label class (tag), that generates probabilites for each tag for each post. It becomes easy to imagine that this can quickly get out of hand, both in memory usage and training time.

***

To that end, a balance has to be struck regarding number of samples and number of tags to include in the model; below, we'll see the quarterly post counts to give a sense for how many posts are created over time.

![graph4](./images/quarterly_posts.png)

## Data Preparation

Because of its similarity to the Python dataset, the same preparation steps will be undertaken for this dataset.

The only difference is in including the tags, which are simply joined into a list for each post.

## Data Modeling

As said before, a balance has to be found regarding the number of samples to build the model with, and how many tags to use - the latter will determine how many individual classifiers will need to be trained.

***
### Number of Samples

The dataset has 1,264,216 posts, with many more answers, and 1-5 tags for each post.

Since it would be prohibitive to build a model with every sample unless it was obviously much more accurate, I investigated whether the tag usage changes drastically over time, which would suggest that smaller models built using a subset of the data that is more similar to the data to be predicted would yield better results.

![graph1](./images/usage_1.png)

![graph2](./images/usage_2.png)

Among the top-256 tags, these show that the fastest-growing and -shrinking tags are definitely fluctuating drastically in proportion to the field of tags in the entire dataset.

Let's also look at how much the ranking of top tags changes over time.

RBO (Rank Biased Overlap) is a measure of similarity between two ranked lists, and is appropriate here because of the nature of the top-tags rankings over time. This measure accounts for position as well as whether tags exist in both lists. Below, we'll see the measure of each quarter's RBO when its top rankings are compared with the previous quarter's.

RBO is interpreted as a measure of similarity, with 1.0 being exactly the same, and 0.0 as completely different lists.

* RBO resources:

    * https://github.com/ragrawal/measures/blob/master/measures/rankedlist/RBO.py

    * https://ragrawal.wordpress.com/2013/01/18/comparing-ranked-list/

    * http://codalism.com/research/papers/wmz10_tois.pdf

![graph3](./images/RBO.png)

As we can see, the amount of RBO similarity stabilizes around .55 - .65, so there is (colloquially) a quarter-to-quarter churn of about 35-45% in terms of the top-tag rankings.

***

Thus, it would make sense to only use data that is relatively recent to the data that you want to predict tags for.

In the EDA and prep/modeling notebooks, more exhaustive exploration of this is undertaken. Ultimately, a subset of 200,000 samples seems to make the most sense here, as that accounts for roughly the last year or so of data, and is a nice balance between being hyper-focused on a period of time, and building a large, robust model.

***

### Number of Tags

The tags of the dataset are unevenly distributed among the posts. A small number account for the vast majority of used tags, and a very large number of tags are used very rarely, or even just once.

Below is a representation of how many posts have at least one of the top-n tags:

![graph3](./images/top_tag_pcts.png)

Thus, I decided to settle on 2,000 top tags, which accounts for around 97% of posts having at least one of the tags. This allowed for a model that could be built and trained with a feasible amount of memory and training time, and achieved good results.

### Model selection

There are several options available for multi-label classification, but the most often-used are:

- One-vs-Rest
    - A collection of individual models for each tag (in this case, a SGD-Logistic Regression model)
- Classifier Chain
    - Similar to a decision tree, it filters posts through various classifiers to arrive at a collection of predicted tags

After experimenting with these options, the One-vs-Rest classifier made the most sense to use in this project. Using SGD-Logistic Regression allows for the individual models to train relatively quickly, and model has the ability to predict probabilities for each tag for each post, allowing for a ranked list to be created that can populate a predicted top-20 ranking for each post.

### Metrics

Since measures like accuracy, f1, etc become cumbersome when dealing with a vast number of target classes, there are two main metrics I used to determine the performance of the model.

#### Hamming loss
   * A calculation of similarity between two lists. This ranges from 0-1 (0 being best), and in this case, the values tend to be very small due to the large number of possible tags.
   * In-depth paper on multi-label algorithms, with lots of info about hamming loss:
        * <a id="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mohammad-Sorower-2/publication/266888594_A_Literature_Survey_on_Algorithms_for_Multi-label_Learning/links/57fdb69308ae6750f80665b5/A-Literature-Survey-on-Algorithms-for-Multi-label-Learning.pdf">Sorower, Mohammad. (2023). A Literature Survey on Algorithms for Multi-label Learning.</a>
   
#### Top-20 Prediction metrics
   - This is my own method of determining how well the model does across all of the predictions. For each post, using the predicted probabilities, I can then calculate the following based on whether each post's actual set of tags are in the predicted list. The goal is to have all of the 'true' tags in the suggested tag list.
   - The two main measures are:
        - % of tags that exist in their post's predicted top-20
        - Average score of posts' tag set that are in the predicted top-20

![graph3](./images/top20_scores.png)

![graph3](./images/dist_tag_scores.png)

![graph3](./images/dist_by_n_tags.png)

![graph3](./images/tag_scores.png)

### Evaluation

Based on the scores above, and the visualizations of the results, the results are strong and encouraging.

Across all tags (not just the 2,000 used to build the model) over 75% are present in the predicted top-20. Just among the top 2,000, almost 89% are present.

The average proportion of a post's tags that are present in the predicted top-20 is 75%, and almost half are perfectly predicted.

The hamming loss metric is very very low, lower than the other results from the modelling experiments notebook.

***

In application to the business, this would be a good way to suggest tags to users. Since this is a relatively subjective thing (exactly which tags or amount of tags is best for a question is very subjective) complete accuracy may not be necessary. The intuition here is that this can be a useful tool for helping users select the proper tags at the moment they're posting it, and seeing them presented would save the user time.

In addition, it's not hard to imagine an implementation in which the user can either select or remove the suggested tags from the predicted list, and more results could populate it, increasing the likelihood of the 'true' tags appearing.

***

Although this is a large dataset, this is only 10% of the Stack Overflow questions from this period (2008-2016). With the full dataset, and more robust computational resources, an even larger and more complete model could possibly be constructed and yield even higher performance.

# Conclusions

## Recommendations

In both components of this project, the results suggest that these features could feasibly be developed based on the performance of the models.

### Question Quality

Even using a relatively small sample of posts, this model can be used to alert users when their post is likely to be low-quality.

Because there is still a %15 chance or so of mis-classifying a post, the alert would likely need to be worded so as not to be definitively 'this is a bad post!'. Finding the right balance between being clear and being respectful would be paramount.

Assuming Stack Overflow has a vast collection of more data, a larger and more robust model could be built that could likely do even better at flagging low-quality posts.

Overall, the ability to alert users could save time (both human and on the technical backend) in having to identify poor questions and either reach out to have them edited, or remove them. As well, it would hopefully lead to users being more likely to revise their questions and end up with a better contribution to the community.

### Tag Suggestion

Similarly, the tag prediction model here shows that it's possible to extend its use to creating a top-20 list of suggested tags, and that the predictions are accurate and will likely lead to users better tagging their posts.

Based on analysis, using a model with data only from recent post history is likely the best choice, to make sure that up-to-date tag and question relationships are being included in the model. Also, the density of questions vs. time seems to be highest in the latest period of time (up to 2016) and would likely be even higher in more recent years.

## Limitations and Future Work

Especially with the Tag Suggestion model, more work could likely be done to increase the various metrics and scores, and ensure that more of the 'true' tags are included in the predicted top-20 lists. More memory and computational resources would allow for larger and more in-depth modelling, and exploration of different, more expensive but possibly higher-performing models.

* Specific to Tag Suggestion - The less-used tags are much harder to model and suggest accurately; this is likely also influencing the low-performing metrics for posts with >=3 tags, as I suspect that posts with only 1 or 2 tags use the more common tags, while the posts with more tags are more likely to have the less-used tags.

***

Beyond these models and goals, there are two areas I especially noticed might warrant further work.

### Tailored quality alerts

Exploration of whether there is a way to identify and alert users as to specific issues with a question that can be improved.

### Tag trend prediction

Exploration of whether predicting tag trends would be feasible, and possible connections to other datasets and intersections with the wider tech world.
